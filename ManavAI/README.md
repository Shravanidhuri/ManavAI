 🌐 ManasAI – AI for Humanity

ManasAI is a human-centered platform that uses AI to address real-world challenges in crisis response, accessibility, and civic participation. Designed with inclusivity in mind, ManasAI features three core services aimed at empowering communities and individuals.



🔹 Features

 🆘 Crisis Helpline Triage (Chatbot)

A supportive AI chatbot that offers an initial conversation space for individuals facing mental health or disaster-related crises. It gathers key information through chat and routes urgent cases to live human counselors when necessary.

 📄 Literacy Lifeline (Document Assistant)

Upload any document—legal, medical, government, or other—and our AI will read it aloud and explain it in clear, simple language. Ideal for low-literacy adults and those needing help with complex information.

 🗣️ Civic Voice Hub (Local Issue Resolver)

Residents can input problems in their area—like potholes, water issues, or power outages—and our system forwards the issue to the appropriate local authority. Users also receive timely updates on the resolution status.




## 🌍 Our Vision

ManasAI is built on the belief that AI should serve the public good. We aim to create accessible, reliable, and ethical solutions that uplift underserved communities and promote human dignity.
